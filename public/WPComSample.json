That&#8217;s all I can say. What a weekend. I knew it would be challenging but I didn&#8217;t realise quite how much. I had a bit of a lie-in on\u00a0Saturday and started my takeaway app at 12. By 2&#8217;o&#8217;clock I was seriously starting to get stressed. I&#8217;ve probably said it before but I find it SO HARD TO JUST GET DAMN STARTED. I&#8217;ve just got no idea and I start to get filled with this sense of fear and dread. I end up working myself into a pure state of frustration which is obviously not going to help my situation. I tried to plan, tried to do CRC cards (Class, Responsibility, Collaboration &#8211; to help us map out what is happening) but even then I found that difficult. I worked on it till about 8 when I took a break for dinner and then decided to start the whole thing again as I realised I was going down the wrong route! After dinner I ended up working till midnight and went to bed tired and frustrated <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-sad' title=':('>:(<\/span> Sunday I worked on it from 11 and that evening I think I hit my lowest point so far. I really felt like I had no idea and my direction was all confused, none of my ideas seemed to mesh together. Nothing seemed to be working and I either wanted to throw my laptop against the wall or burst into tears. (There may have actually been tears). Thankfully I got it semi working by 1 in the morning and even got to do a little bit of the inject method. The good\u00a0part was that I got the text message part working and received many, many texts to my phone telling me that my cereal would be with me soon. Yes I did a cereal takeaway app <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-smile' title=':)'>:)<\/span> No the cereal never turned up <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-sad' title=':('>:(<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/katebeavis.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/02\/fullsizerender-2.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-92 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/katebeavis.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/02\/fullsizerender-2.jpg?w=300&#038;h=300\" alt=\"FullSizeRender 2\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a> On Monday I arrived at eight to work some more on it and when I asked the first person I saw how they found the challenge, I got that knowing look and nervous laugh &#8211; turns out that pretty much everybody was tearing their hair out in frustration. It&#8217;s one of the few times that I&#8217;m happy to see people struggle, at least I know we&#8217;re all in the same boat! Monday didn&#8217;t bring much apart from trying a lecture on how we should have done our challenges and then trying to rewrite them. In the evening we met the March cohort for whom we will be mentors! This is crazy, we&#8217;ve only been doing this course for 2 weeks and now we&#8217;re going to have people asking us questions and coming to us for help! I&#8217;m so not ready for that.

Ten","URL":"https:\/\/katebeavis.wordpress.com\/2015\/02\/13\/day-ten\/","short_URL":"http:\/\/wp.me\/p5IPQS-1i","content":"<p>So here I am at the end of another week at Makers! And today was no ordinary day\u2026nope, it was Friday the 13th! Unlucky for me? Apparently so\u2026<\/p>\n<p>I started it off with my first lie-in, getting in at a shocking 9:30 and I felt really guilty as I have so much to do. We started off by being introduced to the weekend challenge which consisted of two parts &#8211; rewrite the \u2018inject\u2019 method for the array class and write a takeaway app, which will be able to have a list of dishes with prices, be able to add to an order, calculate totals and send a text (yes, a real life text!) to a phone if the order is completed.<\/p>\n<p>I got stuck into the inject rewrite as I thought the takeaway app was going to take a while and I wanted to wait till the weekend when I could really get my teeth stuck into it. The problem was that we hadn\u2019t been introduced to this method yet and it took a good few hours to even work out what it does as it\u2019s quite complicated. I quickly realised that it was going to be a lot harder than I realised and started to feel a bit stressed out. This wasn\u2019t helped by the fact that I was starting to feel a little strange\u2026a lot of people have been off with flu and even though I didn\u2019t have a cough or sore throat, I was just feeling \u2018off.\u2019 Kind of achy and tired and I just couldn\u2019t focus. This meant that I couldn\u2019t stare at a computer screen for too long, so I distracted myself by heading out for lunch (definitely recommend the Katsu wraps from Petticoat Lane market!), having numerous cups of tea and chatting with various people.<\/p>\n<p>It was one of these talks that led me to my later actions of the day\u2026I sort of stumbled on two of my cohort sitting on beanbags having a bit of a heart to heart as one of them was feeling quite down and stressed. The things he was saying echoed just how I was feeling &#8211; stressed, not feeling like you\u2019re learning anything and generally putting too much pressure on your self. Gabe (who I see as the \u2018therapist\u2019 of the group &#8211; he\u2019s always there if you want to chat), was telling him that it\u2019s so important not to put too much pressure on yourself and not to feel guilty if you\u2019re not here 12 hours a day. We have enough pressure on us with these long days and so much to learn. Our weekends are taken up by challenges and even our commutes on the train are taken up by studying books.<\/p>\n<p>It was then that I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to stay late tonight. I know that Friday night is great as we all have a few beers and then go out to a pub but I really wasn\u2019t feeling up to it. So I decided to leave at 5:45, go home, have a hot bath and just DO NO CODING. I sat there, on the sofa, watching Eastenders and catching up on the weeks t.v. and you know what? I didn\u2019t feel guilty. Sometimes we really just need to take a step back and focus on ourselves and hopefully (fingers crossed, please, please, please!), everything will fall into place.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><strong>Things I learnt today:<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n-The Inject method<br \/>\n&#8211; To not feel guilty (This won&#8217;t last though!)<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>So here I am at the end of another week at Makers!

For those unenlightened to the concept of SRP, as I was at the start of the week, a brief description. SRP stands for &#8216;single responsibility principle&#8217; and it basically means that a class or module should only have one responsibility. One reason to change. If it has many, and a lot of other code is depending on it, when you have to make a change to one of the responsibilities you end up breaking half of your program and having to rewrite it.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/katebeavis.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/02\/233862525.jpeg\"><img class=\" wp-image-65 size-medium aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/katebeavis.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/02\/233862525.jpeg?w=300&#038;h=300\" alt=\"battleships game\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a>This &#8211; BUT IN CODE<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, end of code talk. As usual we had to do this project in pairs and I paired up with the lovely Julian. We spent most of the morning discussing the concepts of the program, how the classes would interact and what the responsibilities would be before blindly diving into the code and abandoning all of our careful planning. After our afternoon lecture on pair programming and &#8216;MVP&#8217; (minimum viable product &#8211; make it small, make it work, then build it up), we took a step back and got ourselves back on track with &#8216;pigeon steps&#8217; as Julian likes to put it and a few RSPEC tests thrown in for fun <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-smile' title=':)'>:)<\/span><\/p>\n<p>In the\u00a0afternoon we had a cohort catch-up with Dana our chief Joy Officer, which consisted of us sitting around on beanbags and talking about how we feel and what we were thankful for. I actually quite enjoyed it, sort of like group therapy for stressed coders. I was of course thankful for Riz&#8217;s Slack &#8216;train breakdown.&#8217; \u00a0The Feb cohort know what I&#8217;m talking about :p<\/p>\n<p>I was definitely starting to feel stressed today, I&#8217;m finding it hard to know how to tackle big problems and how to take those first steps and to me Battleships is a\u00a0<em>big<\/em> problem. I only hope that in the next few days everything will become clearer and start coming together. Sam the head of education shared a link with us today about &#8216;<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Reflective_practice\">reflective practice<\/a>&#8216; which I found very interesting, and it made me think that writing this blog is my very own form of reflective practice, a way to de-stress.<\/p>\n<p>Talking of reflective practice we had some of our very own in the evening in the form of a drink down the local pub. It was only one mind you&#8230;which turned into two&#8230;and then three, all in the name of de-stressing of course!

week two&#8230;. Um. No. I thought I had gotten my airport challenge working last night and it turned out that I didn&#8217;t and of course, I couldn&#8217;t let it go so I was up till about two trying to make it work. Even after that I had a bad nights sleep, so I wasn&#8217;t too pleased to be dragging myself out of bed at seven in the morning. Why did I have a bad nights sleep? Maybe it was because today was my first dum, dum, dum&#8230; CODE REVIEW!<\/p>\n<p>Really it isn&#8217;t that big a deal &#8211; you sit down with a coach or an engineer and they have a 1-2-1 with you about your challenge code and how you feel you are doing. Still, the first one after you have only been properly writing code for a week is always going to be daunting. We were told in our morning session that slots were going fast because there weren&#8217;t enough available,\u00a0but\u00a0I managed to get the last one (thankfully the last one of the day).<\/p>\n<p>This meant that I had the whole day to work on my code and pretty much rewrite my weather generator with some help from fellow cohort Carrie. My tests were passing but I knew there was something wrong as I couldn&#8217;t get it working as it should in IRB. (The interactive Ruby interpreter that lets you &#8216;play&#8217; with your code).<\/p>\n<p>My code review was with Leo, an engineer and it went okay. Yes my code was wrong but it was more of a syntax problem, I had the general idea right. Leo showed me how to get it right and then refactor it. Wow. I really got to see the beauty of refactoring. He took my code which consisted of three methods and around 10 lines and refactored it to one method and ONE LINE. Maybe I&#8217;m getting too much into this coding thing but it was like a thing of beauty happening before my eyes! We also had a bit of a chat about how I feel I&#8217;m doing in general, and I said that I felt I didn&#8217;t know as much as everybody else in the class. He reiterated the fact that everybody thinks that and bar a few people we are pretty much in the same place.<\/p>\n<p>Something I took from today was something Sam (head of education)\u00a0brought up\u00a0when he was going over our feedback forms. Another member of our cohort had said that they wrote down what they had learnt that day, sort of to reaffirm it and to keep them positive about their learning experience. This is something I&#8217;m going to try myself, on paper and on this blog.

The twist however was that we had to create a &#8216;random number generator&#8217; that would return a weather state of either &#8216;sunny&#8217; or &#8216;stormy.&#8217; And the planes weren&#8217;t allowed to take off if it was stormy.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/katebeavis.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/02\/screen-shot-2015-02-07-at-22-50-50.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-48 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/katebeavis.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/02\/screen-shot-2015-02-07-at-22-50-50.png?w=1024&#038;h=291\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2015-02-07 at 22.50.50\"   \/><\/a>Can you\u00a0<i>believe<\/i>\u00a0THE Boris Johnson was thanking us for our hard work? <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-wink' title=';)'>;)<\/span><\/p>\n<p>I spent part of the morning working on this before heading out for lunch. I&#8217;ve been trying to bring in a packed lunch everyday as obviously I have to save money and I know how much a few quid can add up everyday. It&#8217;s been a bit boring this week (pasta, pasta, pasta) so I&#8217;ve decided that every Friday is going to be &#8216;treat day&#8217; and I will go out for lunch. Luckily this being London, there are plenty of places to go &#8211; Spitalfields market is just down the road, Brick Lane is the street behind us and Petticoat Lane is a few minutes walk away, so that&#8217;s where I went for some tasty Pad Thai noodles!<\/p>\n<p>After lunch\u00a0was &#8216;Code Jam.&#8217; This involves splitting into teams and being given coding challenges which you have 15 minutes to solve. I was unsure about it as I didn&#8217;t think I performed well under pressure but actually it was quite fun and I learned some new things!<\/p>\n<p>After that one of the coaches Roi took us through how to set up a development environment on our computers, I found out a few tips and learnt about some cool programs.<\/p>\n<p>The rest of the day was dedicated to working on our weekend challenge. Shockingly I got most of it done apart from the weather part. It wasn&#8217;t all code, code, code however. Makers provides free beers on a Friday which is really cool so first we coded with beers (hmmm&#8230;productive) and then dropped the coding. A few of us Juniors stayed for a game or two of Ping Pong before moving onto the pub for a few more. A perfect end to the week!<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Wow, a week has flown by already.

We began with a lecture on &#8216;getter&#8217; and &#8216;setter&#8217; methods which are used when we create instance variables. We also learnt how to &#8216;refactor&#8217; our code by using &#8216;accessors.&#8217; I won&#8217;t bore anybody by *attempting* to explain what these are. Refactoring however is when you improve your code by making small changes that don&#8217;t affect the behaviour of it. For example you could rewrite a method to make it one line instead of three. It&#8217;s all about making your code cleaner, clearer &amp; more elegant. Making it easier to read &amp; more understandable for the next developer who comes along.<\/p>\n<p>We were also introduced to &#8216;Fizzbuzz&#8217; which I had heard a lot about it from reading other Makers blogs. Fizzbuzz in essence is a game played by school children to help learn maths. You count to say, 100 and every time you reach a number that is divisible by 3 you say &#8216;Fizz.&#8217; When you reach a number that is divisible by 5 you say &#8216;Buzz.&#8217; When you reach a number that is divisible by 3 &amp; 5 you say &#8216;Fizzbuzz.&#8217; In terms of programming the aim is to write a program that will carry this out.<\/p>\n<p>At Makers they have sort of created a challenge where you have to time yourself every time you write this program (including RSPEC testing of course!) and try to beat your last time. This is a way to try improve your coding abilities. Apparently some people can do it in under five minutes! We were told to try and attempt to do it at least once everyday and I can see it being a fun way of competing against yourself whilst also improving your coding skills under pressure (interviews anyone?!). It also helps you keep up a Github streak!<\/p>\n<p>The rest of the day was dedicated to Boris Bikes and I paired with Joe. I was quite apprehensive about pairing today as I was feeling like I just wasn&#8217;t getting it. In fact at one point I was close to tears as I felt I hadn&#8217;t made any progression and I wouldn&#8217;t be able to contribute anything to the pairing experience.<\/p>\n<p>By an ironic stroke of luck, Joe was pretty much in the same place as me and this is where one of my first revelations started. You would think that it would be best if you were paired with somebody who knows more than you and therefore they could teach you. Yep, this is helpful, you can learn stuff BUT sometimes you *think* you understand what they are telling you and you just nod along and it&#8217;s not till you have to do something on your own, that you realise that you don&#8217;t know what to do.<\/p>\n<p>However, when it came to me and Joe, we literally didn&#8217;t understand what we were doing. Steve our &#8216;main coach&#8217; (who&#8217;s very lovely) came and gave us a few pointers on the RSPEC syntax but still we were a bit stuck. What then happened\u00a0is that we spent most of the day on just two problems and you know what? We learnt! We moved through each problem sooo slowly and made sure that we really got it. I got to feel the true pleasure of seeing your RSPEC tests turn green &#8211; there were definitely woops and high fives!<\/p>\n<p>By\u00a05, I had pretty much completed Boris Bikes (bar refactoring) and felt confident to have a go at my first Fizzbuzz! It wasn&#8217;t a true attempt as I had to kept on referencing the lecture but after writing the first two tests, I barely needed to look it again. I completed it in a shocking hour. Then came the second revelation &#8211; Fizzbuzz really helped me learn my RSPEC syntax! There was something about writing practically the same test over and over again that helped drill it into my head.<\/p>\n<p>I started my fourth day on my biggest low and left on my biggest high so far. It goes to show that even when you are feeling in the dark, have faith, hold on, there is always light at the end of the tunnel &#8211; and that light is green! <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-smile' title=':)'>:)<\/span><\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Right, day four.

It always feels like you are running ahead with the code knowledge one week behind you &#8211; as soon as you start a new week, the things you learnt last week will begin to click.<\/p>\n<p>Next was\u00a0a lecture on classes and objects with a bit of a refresher on instance variables. I&#8217;m pretty sure I&#8217;ve got them, I just get a bit confused when I have to integrate them into the project that I&#8217;m working on. We also learnt about &#8216;doubles&#8217; which sort of work as placeholders for a class. Very useful when you want to work on a particular part of your program but you need it to interact with a part that you haven&#8217;t created yet. Um. If you see what I mean?<\/p>\n<p>I paired with Vanessa today and it was a bit of an eye opener. Basically I thought I knew what I was doing and hey! It turns out that I don&#8217;t! It&#8217;s all fair and well to work through a walkthrough and think that you understand what it&#8217;s doing and why it&#8217;s doing it but when you actually have to write it from scratch yourself, well then you realise you have absolutely no clue about what you&#8217;re doing!<\/p>\n<p>It wasn&#8217;t so much the program itself. It was writing the RSPEC tests that got me. I know what I want it to do but how to tell it that? Nope. No idea. I can&#8217;t seem to get my head around the syntax one bit.<\/p>\n<p>I was then brought down even more when Vanessa and I asked Jordan for some help and he pointed out that there was something weird going on with our code. We hadn&#8217;t either included a class or used a double so our tests shouldn&#8217;t be passing. For some reason (which I still don&#8217;t understand), they were passing as we were testing multiple files together, but if we tested just the individual file it would fail.

Makers isn&#8217;t about spoon feeding you information, sitting behind a computer all day listening to lecture after lecture.\u00a0Instead they\u00a0provide the tools to learn and\u00a0it&#8217;s up to you to create your own journey. With a few yoga sessions thrown in for fun of course!<\/p>\n<p>I studied film &amp; television at university but\u00a0didn&#8217;t feel that it was really for me. Not being one to sit around doing nothing I got a job in a restaurant. Time went by, I moved to London and transferred to a central London location but I was realising more and more that this job that I sort of fell into, was not the job I wanted to do for the rest of my life.<\/p>\n<p>The problem was that I didn&#8217;t know what I wanted to do! There was no way I was going to do a job that didn&#8217;t interest me especially as most decent jobs I would have to go back to uni for. Friends tried to help&#8230;police officer? Nurse? Graphic Designer? Every suggestion given just frustrated me more and more. There was NOTHING that I wanted to do.<\/p>\n<p>It was around the spring of last year that I took a bit of interest in my new flatmates job &#8211; front end web developer. It was like something in me just &#8216;clicked.&#8217; For some reason I thought it sounded so interesting, appealing to both my love of technology and my creative side.<\/p>\n<p>I went on a week long course in HTML &amp; CSS (in which I created my first ever <a href=\"http:\/\/www.katedesigns.co.uk\">website<\/a>!) which I really enjoyed though I found it slow paced. I then tried to teach myself online through <a href=\"http:\/\/teamtreehouse.com\">Treehouse<\/a>. I found it so useful but the problem was that I found I would study away and then I would be busy for a few days and I would just forget what I learnt. Sometimes I would go a whole month without studying. Even though I felt I had a solid base, I knew there was no way I could even get a job as an intern\u00a0with my knowledge level.<\/p>\n<p>I knew the best way for me to learn was in a classroom environment so I looked for a course, one that would be for at least a few months. One of the first places I came across was Makers Academy. From what I initially saw I thought it sounded great. Then I saw the price. \u00a38000 for 12 weeks of study. Immediately I knew I would not be doing the course, I mean that was ridiculously expensive?! I also wanted to become a\u00a0<em>front-end<\/em> developer, whereas Makers focused mainly on back-end.<\/p>\n<p>But for some reason the thought of it kept on coming back to me. The more and more I thought about it, the more I realised that actually, it wasn&#8217;t that much money for how long it is and what you get out at the end of it. Put it this way, my week long course (10am &#8211; 4pm) was \u00a3600 and it moved sooo slowly. I would get a concept and if there were a few other people in the class who didn&#8217;t get it, we would have to go over and over it until they did.<\/p>\n<p>I was also starting to like the look of this back-end thing more. I mean you can create so much. The apps on your phone are programming. ATMs are created with programming. Those lights that are voice activated? Programming! Everything is this day and age is all about software. The world is your oyster and if you have a good idea you can create it.<\/p>\n<p>After some\u00a0research (reading a lot of Makers blogs!), I bit the bullet in November, applied and was invited for an interview. The interview involved logic tests and a bit of coding. Anybody that knows me will know that I get very nervous. I suffer from with\u00a0anxiety and in the interview I was an absolute mess. Part of a\u00a0logic test involved me having at one point to minus 15 from a certain number in my head. I could. not. do. it. I felt like I was on the verge of a panic attack. It didn&#8217;t help knowing\u00a0that they only accept around 10% of applicants. Luckily I calmed down and the coding part went well.<\/p>\n<p>I few days later I was left in a state of shock as I received a phone call telling me that I had been accepted. They thought that I seemed passionate about coding and personality wise\u00a0I would be a good fit. As long as I studied hard in the run up to the course I would be okay. I took the plunge and paid my fees. I was to be a future maker!<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>So my first post is a little about me and why I decided to become a Maker.
